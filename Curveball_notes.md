## 🔄 Curveball Summary
During Workshop 2, your team faced an unexpected change or challenge that tested adaptability.  
Briefly describe what happened, referencing one or more **Curveball Cards** from the activity in  
[`Curveball_brief.md`](./Curveball_brief.md).

> _Example:_  
> The client requested support for new image formats (HEIC) late in development.  
> This required adjustments in the preprocessing pipeline and cost estimation.

Once you’ve summarised your response here, continue to the  
**[Curveball Task – In-Depth Brief](./Curveball_task.md)**  
to explore the same scenario from a governance, DPIA, and lawful-processing perspective.

## 🧩 Adaptation Strategy
**1. What changed:**  
_Describe the new constraint, data shift, or stakeholder request (e.g. Budget Cut, Data Bias Identified, or Regulatory Scrutiny)._  

**2. How we adapted:**  
_List the technical or organisational steps taken to respond._  

**3. Who led the adaptation:**  
_Assign names and roles (e.g. Data Lead, UX Lead, Compliance Advisor)._

## ⚠️ New or Updated Risks
If the curveball introduced new risks, record them here and cross-reference your  
[`risk_register.md`](./risk_register.md).  

| ID | New / Changed Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|----|--------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
| R4 | _Example:_ Model retraining required due to new data format. | Medium | High | Schedule retrain post-demo; document in DPIA. | Priya | 🟠 Monitoring |

## 💬 Reflection
__PLEASE NOTE: "Any reflective questions that do not have KSBs associated with them are designed to help you consolidate learning after each workshop. They are lighter in nature than CPD questions and CPD tasks and do not directly contribute to KSB evidence. If you ever feel short on time, please prioritise completing your CPD questions and CPD tasks (which appear in Aptem and link directly to your KSBs) before returning to your reflections. Coaches will review your answers to support your progress and catch any misunderstandings, but they are not formally graded."__
- What did this teach us about flexibility in ML projects?  
- How can this inform future governance or sprint planning?  
- Which of these insights link to compliance or data-protection considerations explored in the  
  [`curveball_task.md`](./Curveball_task.md) exercise?

> 💡 **Tip:**  
> Curveballs are not failures — they are **evidence of adaptive engineering**.  
> Linking your technical adaptations to compliance reasoning shows mature AI engineering practice.
