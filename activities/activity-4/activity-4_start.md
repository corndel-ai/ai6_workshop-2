# Risk Curveball Challenge
## Scenario
Your team has been working on the Derm-Assist MVP: a tool to help GPs triage skin lesion images. Suddenly, new information arrives; your project environment has changed.

**Your job: adapt your MVP project board to reflect the new constraint.**
1. Assess the impact on your MoSCoW priorities and user stories.
2. Update your Project Board.
3. Prepare a 3-minute summary explaining what you changed and why.

**Remember:**
Agility is not just speed. It’s the ability to absorb shocks, make trade-offs, and keep the project moving responsibly.

---
## Deliverables from your team
- Updated Project Board showing changes in scope, reprioritisation, and/or new compliance stories.
- 3-minute team summary explaining:
	- What changed.
	- Why the decision was made.
	- How it maintains MVP focus while addressing the new constraint.
- You can use [`curveball-notes.md`](./curveball-notes.md) to structure your notes from this.
