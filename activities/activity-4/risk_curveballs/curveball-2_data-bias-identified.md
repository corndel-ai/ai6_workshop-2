# Data Bias Identified🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏻

**_A report reveals that your dataset under-represents darker skin tones, leading to poor model performance for certain demographics._**

**Hints for Adaptation:**
- Add a new user story: _Audit dataset composition and record fairness risks in the DPIA._
- Consider synthetic data augmentation (e.g. balanced image generation).
- Plan to collect targeted samples (even if only flagged as "Future Work”".
- Introduce mitigation strategies: e.g. flag low-confidence predictions for human review.
- Could this move into a "Should have" compliance deliverable?
