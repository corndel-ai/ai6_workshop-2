# Accessibility Requirement ♿

***New guidance requires that all digital tools used in NHS settings must meet accessibility standards. Your MVP must now include basic accessibility features.***

**Hints for Adaptation:**
- Add user story: _"As a GP with visual impairment, I want the tool to support screen readers so that I can use it effectively."_
- Consider UI simplification, alt-text for images, and colour contrast.
- Reprioritise visual features that may not meet accessibility standards.
