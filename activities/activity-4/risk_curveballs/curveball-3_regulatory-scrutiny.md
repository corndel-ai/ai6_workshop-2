# Regulatory Scrutiny ⚖️

**_New guidance requires AI systems used in healthcare triage to support a ‘right to explanation.’ Your planned black-box model is no longer acceptable._**

**Hints for Adaptation:**
- Add user story: _Document explainability requirements in risk register._
- Switch model choice: consider interpretable models (decision trees, logistic regression) for MVP.
- Add a compliance checklist card for EU AI Act "high-risk AI" documentation.
- Reduce complexity elsewhere to free capacity for this new requirement.
