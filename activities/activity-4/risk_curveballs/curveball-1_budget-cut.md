# Budget Cut 💰

**_Your cloud compute budget has been halved. You can no longer afford to fine-tune or deploy large models as planned._**

**Hints for Adaptation:**
- Consider cheaper deployment models (e.g. batch jobs, serverless endpoints, or Hugging Face Spaces).
- Explore alternative clouds or open-source options with free tiers.
- Reduce scope: focus only on the "Musts."
- Re-prioritise infrastructure user stories. IaC might be a _Won’t have_ for now.
