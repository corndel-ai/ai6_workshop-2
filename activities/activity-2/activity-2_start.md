# Derm-Assist Project Board
## Deliverables from your team
- A project board containing user stories generated from all "Musts" shared by the workshop group (the column doesn't matter, could be TODO or Backlog).
- At least two **compliance-flavoured user stories** added to your board e.g.:
	- Draft **DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) skeleton** (GDPR).
	- **Risk flag register + compliance checklist** (EU AI Act).
- Add a clear definition of done to every user story you add to your board.
- (Optionally, does the user story need refining or clarifying?).

Think about whether any of you will be comfortable volunteering to share your project board in front of all learners. We will ask for a volunteer from one group for sharing.

## Hints
1. **Be specific with your user stories.** A good user story starts with a clear user and a clear goal.
2. **Think about what "done" looks like.** For each story, ask: How will we know when this is complete? Can it be tested? Is it measurable? This helps you define success clearly.
3. **Keep it lean.** This is a one-sprint MVP. If a feature feels too big or too complex, ask yourself: _Can we simplify it? Can we defer it?_ Focus on what delivers the most learning value with the least effort.
4. **Use active language.** When writing actions or mitigation strategies, use verbs like _flag_, _record_, _display_, _escalate_. It makes your board clearer and more actionable.
