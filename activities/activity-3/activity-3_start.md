- Populate it with at least two risks.

## Hints
- Do a web search for "risk register template", ask an LLM to produce a minimal set of relevant fields, or use the example in [`risk-register.md`](./risk-register.md).
- Consider the categories of risk we have discussed today and that you've covered in your e-learning: data risks, budget risks, user risks, and ethical risks.
